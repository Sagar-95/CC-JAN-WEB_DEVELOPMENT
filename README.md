#CC TASK-1 Sentimental Analysis

In this task , I have created a sentimental analysis website , this is looping through arrays and replacing the lexicon word in the user input box with the same word styled by class. Then the classes are counted and multiplied by their positive or negative scores. These are averaged out to give a sentiment score from -5 to 5. This method allows it to match word groups as well as individual words. It automatically detects the emotion related to a particular word.
